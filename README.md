# Aura

Aura is a hyperlocal social network that relies on Bluetooth LE and doesn't use internet or wifi.

## How does it work?
* Your Aura is an always-on digital profile that contains sparks, small shareable ideas.
* These sparks are spread from Aura to Aura to eventually change the world.

## Censorship Sucks.
Thoughts are free. Sharing them can be dangerous. 
With Aura you can share ideas anonymously with people around. 
It works person-to-person without internet, can't be blocked and leaves no traces with your phone operator.

## License
Aura is not licenses at the moment. I want to license it under an open source license when I have the resources to properly manage contributions and the community.
The code is still public to allow audits and to prove that there's bot backdoors or hidden security flaws.
